## 2024 revamp ideas
### Features
- GH API integration to parse projects and render dynamically
- Create a resume API that fetches recent/relevant experience so I don't have to always hard code.
- Blinking cursor + typewriter effect? (inspo: https://www.amitmerchant.com/simple-blinking-cursor-animation-using-css/)

### Aesthetic
- Super simple/minimal. Want to churn this out fast.
- At the same time, very intentional subtle effects to indicate attention to detail
- Let it breath
- Limit scrolling if possible. Last iteration required way too much time to get a look at
- Sticky contact me + resume
- Toggle between nav bar + routing and SPA layout
